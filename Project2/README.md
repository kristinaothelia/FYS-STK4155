# Project 2: Classification and Regression, from linear and logistic regression to neural networks
## Overview:

This project looks into both logistic regression and neural networks, studying both classification and regression problems. As a starting point for building our models for classification, we have used the Taiwan credit card data. After developing our logistic regression and neural network models, we evaluate the credit card data to compare the methods. The results may be viewed in the repository Results_Log and Results_NN. After this we have also used the Franke's function and perform a regression analysis using neural network, to compare with the results from Project 1 (Results_Franke).

## Running the code:
Run the classification models and regression model by main.py, with one of the input arguments listed below. 

- "Log"     : Logistic regression
- "NN"      : Neural Network
- "linreg"  : Neural Network Regression, with Franke's function


## Running the pytest:
run: pytest -W ignore::DeprecationWarning

### Participants:
