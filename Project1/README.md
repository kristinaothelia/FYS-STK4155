# Project 1: Regression analysis and resampling methods
## Overview:
This project looks at different regression methods (OLS, Rigde and Lasso) and determines how well they fit to a noisy generated data set, as well as real data. With resampling, k-fold CV.

Polynomials are fitted to the Franke function, as well as real data from a crater on Mars (.tiff file). 

MSE and R2 score is used for regression analysis. 

## Running the code:
In order to run the model, the python script project1.py is run in the terminal. 

Use pytest in the terminal window to run a test


### Note:
In order to save figures and txt files, the user needs to have an folder "Results/" in the run directory.
