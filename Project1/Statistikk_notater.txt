random variable y: the dependent, the outcome or the response variable
x=[x0,x1,…,xn−1]T: the independent variable, or the predictor variable or the explanatory variable 

A regression model aims at finding a likelihood function p(y|x), that is the conditional distribution for y with a given x.

The estimation of p(y|x) is made using a data set with:
	- n cases i=0,1,2,…,n−1
	- Response (target, dependent or outcome) variable yi with i=0,1,2,…,n−1
	- p so-called explanatory (independent or predictor) variables xi=[xi0,xi1,…,xip−1] with i=0,1,2,…,n−1 and explanatory variables running from 0 to p−1. See below for more explicit examples.

The goal of the regression analysis is to extract/exploit relationship between y and x in or to infer causal dependencies, approximations to the likelihood functions, functional relationships and to make predictions, making fits and many other things.


β=[β0,…,βp−1]T are the regression parameters.
Linear regression gives us a set of analytical equations for the parameters βj.
